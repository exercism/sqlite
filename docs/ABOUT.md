# About

[SQLite][sqlite] is an open-source lightweight, serverless, and self-contained relational database management system.
It is known for its simplicity, ease of use, and zero configuration requirements.
SQLite is embedded within applications, making it an ideal choice for apps, embedded systems, and small to medium-scale projects.

Created by [D. Richard Hipp][hipp], SQLite follows the ACID properties, ensuring reliable transactions.
It is widely used in various industries thanks to its minimal footprint and efficient performance.

SQLite employs a straightforward and SQL-based syntax for defining and interacting with databases.
Tables, indexes, and queries are created using standard SQL statements, providing developers with a familiar and expressive way to manage data.
The database engine is self-contained, eliminating the need for a separate server process.
This simplicity, combined with its powerful capabilities, makes SQLite an excellent choice for projects where ease of use and efficiency are a priority.
