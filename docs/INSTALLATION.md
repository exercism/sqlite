# Installation

## Target Version

Testing for this track is based on version __3.37__.
While users may have newer versions installed, they should be aware that some features may not work with our test runner.
Features can be compared on [SQLite version history][version-history].
The version was chosen to maintain maintain compatibility with users on Ubuntu 22.04, the current LTS version.
When the next LTS comes into rotation, we will also update our track.

## Windows

To install SQLite on Windows, follow these steps:

1. Download the precompiled windows binaries from the [official download page][sqlite-download].
2. Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a directory of your choice.
   For example, `C:\Program Files\sqlite3`.
3. Add the directory containing `sqlite3.exe` to the system's PATH environment variable.
   The process is a little different for each Windows version, but the information should be easy to search.
   For example [instructions for Windows 11][windows-11-install] and [Windows 10][windows-10-install].

On macOS, SQLite is pre-installed.
However, if you need a newer version, you can use [Homebrew][homebrew]:

## Other installation routes and older versions
