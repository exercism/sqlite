# Run all available tests on the example/exemplar solution.

# Arguments:
# $1: exercise slug

# $3: path to output directory

# Output:
# Writes the test results to a results.json file in the passed-in output directory.
# The test results are formatted according to the specifications at https://github.com/exercism/docs/blob/main/building/tooling/test-runners/interface.md
