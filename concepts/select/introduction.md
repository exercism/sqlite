# Introduction

The SQL `SELECT` statement is the mechanism for querying  -- retrieving data from -- a database.  The result of a `SELECT` statement is a dataset -- some number of values arranged in rows and columns, where each column is a particular attribute of the data and each row is a set of values for each column.  With a `SELECT` statement, you can specify the data you want and optionally transform, filter, and/or modify the shape of the output data.
