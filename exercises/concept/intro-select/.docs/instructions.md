# Instructions

You are a data analyst at a firm that analyzes weather data in the Pacific Northwest.  You will be working with a database containing a `weather_data` table with the following columns:

* `date`:  The date on which the sample was collected.
* `location`:  The name of the city in which the sample was collected.
* `temperature`:  The temperature, in degrees Fahrenheit.
* `humidity`:  The relative humidity, as a percentage value.

In each of the following tasks, your job is to gather the specified result set, by using a `SELECT` statement.
Note that in each case, the result set will be stored in a new table -- one table for each task -- via a pre-written `CREATE TABLE` statement.
Your job for each task is to add the appropriate `SELECT` statement within the existing `CREATE TABLE` statement.
