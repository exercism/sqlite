# Introduction

In SQL, a `SELECT` statement allows you to retrieve data from a database.
The result of a `SELECT` statement is a result set.
A result set contains values arranged in rows and columns.
Each column is a particular attribute of the data.
Each row contains a value for every column.

One way to think about it is that a set of columns represents a data structure, where each column represents a field of the data structure, and each row represents an instance of the data structure.

With a `SELECT` statement, you can specify the data you want to retrieve.
You can also optionally transform, filter, and/or modify the shape of the output data.

## The basics

The anatomy of a basic `SELECT` statement is as follows:

```sql
SELECT <columns>
FROM <source>
WHERE <criteria>;
```

~~~~exercism/note
The `FROM` and `WHERE` clauses are optional.
For example, a statement like `SELECT "Hello, world.";` is perfectly valid.

Also note that the line breaks are not required; any spacing will suffice to separate the different clauses (i.e. parts) of the `SELECT` statement.

Immediately following the `SELECT` keyword is a list of the columns that you want in the result.
The `FROM` clause identifies the source of the data, which is typically a table in the database.
The `WHERE` clause filters the output data by one or more criteria.

For example, consider a database with a table named `inventory` containing the following data:

|     upc      |  category  |    supplier    |    brand    |           product_name           | weight | stock |
|--------------|------------|----------------|-------------|----------------------------------|--------|-------|
| 812345670019 | Cookware   | KitchenCo      | HearthStone | 10" Non-Stick Skillet            | 1.8    | 42    |
| 845678120334 | Utensils   | HomePro Supply | PrepMaster  | Stainless Steel Ladle            | 0.4    | 120   |
| 899001234556 | Appliances | Culinary Depot | QuickBrew   | Single-Serve Coffee Maker        | 4.2    | 18    |
| 823450987112 | Cookware   | KitchenCo      | FreshKeep   | 12-Piece Glass Container Set     | 6      | 33    |
| 867530900221 | Utensils   | HomePro Supply | EdgeCraft   | 8' Chef's Knife                  | 0.6    | 27    |
| 880012349876 | Appliances | Culinary Depot | HeatWave    | Compact Toaster Oven             | 7.5    | 14    |
| 833221109443 | Utensils   | HomePro Supply | PureScrub   | Heavy-Duty Kitchen Sponge (3-pk) | 0.2    | 200   |
| 899998877665 | Cookware   | KitchenCo      | IronCraft   | Cast-Iron Grill Pan              | 5.3    | 21    |
| 844110220987 | Appliances | Culinary Depot | BlendPro    | High-Speed Personal Blender      | 3.1    | 16    |

If we want to retrieve all of the data from the table, we could run the following query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM inventory;
```

Result:

```
upc           category    supplier        brand        product_name                      weight  stock
------------  ----------  --------------  -----------  --------------------------------  ------  -----
812345670019  Cookware    KitchenCo       HearthStone  10" Non-Stick Skillet             1.8     42   
845678120334  Utensils    HomePro Supply  PrepMaster   Stainless Steel Ladle             0.4     120

823450987112  Cookware    KitchenCo       FreshKeep    12-Piece Glass Container Set      6       33

880012349876  Appliances  Culinary Depot  HeatWave     Compact Toaster Oven              7.5     14

899998877665  Cookware    KitchenCo       IronCraft    Cast-Iron Grill Pan               5.3     21   
844110220987  Appliances  Culinary Depot  BlendPro     High-Speed Personal Blender       3.1     16   
```

If we only want the category and product_name values, we could specify those columns:

```sql
SELECT category, product_name FROM inventory;
```

Result:

```
category    product_name                    
----------  --------------------------------
Cookware    10" Non-Stick Skillet           
Utensils    Stainless Steel Ladle           
Appliances  Single-Serve Coffee Maker       
Cookware    12-Piece Glass Container Set    
Utensils    8' Chef's Knife                 
Appliances  Compact Toaster Oven            
Utensils    Heavy-Duty Kitchen Sponge (3-pk)
Cookware    Cast-Iron Grill Pan             
Appliances  High-Speed Personal Blender     
```

## Filtering data with the WHERE clause

The `WHERE` clause allows you to filter the data retrieved by a `SELECT` statement.
For example, if we only want Appliances, we can do the following:

```sql
SELECT * FROM inventory
WHERE category = "Appliances";
```

Result:
```
upc           category    supplier        brand      product_name                 weight  stock
------------  ----------  --------------  ---------  ---------------------------  ------  -----
899001234556  Appliances  Culinary Depot  QuickBrew  Single-Serve Coffee Maker    4.2     18   
880012349876  Appliances  Culinary Depot  HeatWave   Compact Toaster Oven         7.5     14   
844110220987  Appliances  Culinary Depot  BlendPro   High-Speed Personal Blender  3.1     16   
```

Or maybe we only want data where the weight is between 2.0 and 6.0:

```sql
SELECT * FROM inventory
WHERE weight BETWEEN 2.0 AND 6.0;
```

Result:
```
upc           category    supplier        brand      product_name                  weight  stock
------------  ----------  --------------  ---------  ----------------------------  ------  -----
899001234556  Appliances  Culinary Depot  QuickBrew  Single-Serve Coffee Maker     4.2     18   
823450987112  Cookware    KitchenCo       FreshKeep  12-Piece Glass Container Set  6       33   
899998877665  Cookware    KitchenCo       IronCraft  Cast-Iron Grill Pan           5.3     21   
844110220987  Appliances  Culinary Depot  BlendPro   High-Speed Personal Blender   3.1     16   
```
