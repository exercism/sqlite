# Instructions

You are a data analyst at a firm that analyzes weather data in the Pacific Northwest.
You will be working with a database containing a `weather_readings` table with the following columns.

* `date`: The date on which the sample was collected.
* `location`: The name of the city in which the sample was collected.
* `temperature`: The temperature, in degrees Fahrenheit.
* `wind_speed`: The wind speed, in miles per hour.

In each of the following tasks, your job is to retrieve the specified result set, by using a `SELECT` statement.
Note that in each case, the result set will be stored in a new table -- one table for each task -- via a pre-written `CREATE TABLE` statement.
For now, don't worry about the `CREATE TABLE`; that will be covered in another lesson.
Just focus on adding the appropriate `SELECT` statement to accomplish the given task.

## 1. Retrieve all of the data

Retrieve all of the data from the `weather_readings` table.

## 2. Retrieve only the location and temperature data

Retrieve only the location and temperature values from the `weather_readings` table.

## 3. Retrieve only data for Seattle

Retrieve only the data for the Seattle location.

## 4. Retrieve only the data with wind speed in a specific range

Retrieve only the data where the wind speed is between 5 and 15 miles per hour.
