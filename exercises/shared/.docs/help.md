# Help

If you're stuck on something, it may help to look at some of the [available resources](https://exercism.org/docs/tracks/sqlite/resources) or ask [The Exercism Community on Discord](https://exercism.org/r/discord).

Additionally, [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/sqlite) is a good spot to search for your problem/question to see if it has been answered already.
If not, you can always [ask](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask) or [answer](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-answer) someone else's question.
